#All Our Yesterdays

All Our Yesterdays is the website for my Master's Thesis for NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program.

The site is an interactive exploration of photography, time and our relationship to the sun using CartoDB data visualizations and timeline visualizations. Instagram data mining is collected from the Instagram API using a Node.js Heroku web app I created as part of my studies at ITP.
